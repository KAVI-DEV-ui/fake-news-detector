# The Fake News Detector

The [Fake News Detector](https://fakenewsdetector.org/) is an extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-news-detector/alomdfnfpbaagehmdokilpbjcjhacabk)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fakenews-detector/)
that allows you to detect and flag news directly from your Facebook into
**Legitimate**, **Fake News**, **Click Bait**, **Extremely Biased**, **Satire** or **Not news**.

After flagging a newstory, other people that have the extension will be able to see your flagging,
will pay more attention to it and may also flag it. The data is then saved on a database and read by our robot,
[Robinho](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/fake-news-detector/tree/master/robinho).

Robinho reads the information given by us humans and learn with time to automatically flag
news as Fake News, Click Bait, etc, based on its text. By doing that, even fresh news that no
one saw may be quickly flagged.
